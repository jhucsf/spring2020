## Grading

Your course grade will be determined as follows:

* Written homework: 15%
* Programming assignments: 40%
* Exams: 40%
* Clicker quizzes: 5%

## Academic integrity expectations

Programming assignments are *individual* assignments: the work you submit must be your original work.  Do not copy code from other sources, including (but not limited to) other students' work and web pages.  You may discuss assignments with other students as long as your discussion is at a high level â€” general approach, strategy, etc.  You may *not* share code. Discussions that involve looking at someone else's code, or allowing someone else (other than an instructor, TA, or CA) to look at your code, are violations of the academic integrity policy.

Written assignments may be done in collaboration with other students as long as two conditions are met:

1. The collaboration must be a true collaboration, meaning that you actively contribute to the solution
2. You must mention the students that you worked with

TODO: do we need to say anything about exams?

TODO: say something about procedure for suspected violations of academic integrity?
