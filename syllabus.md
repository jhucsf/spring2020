## Course description

This course is an introduction to *computer systems*.  We will cover a variety of
topics, all of which are focused on techniques needed to develop software which can
take advantage of the capabilities offered by modern computer hardware,
operating systems, and networks.

## Course topics

* Machine-level data representation
* Computer architecture
* Assembly-language programming
* Performance optimization
* Memory hierarchy and caching
* Virtual memory
* Networks
* Concurrency

## Prerequisites

Required: Intermediate Programming (EN.601.220 or equivalent)

## Textbook

There is no required textbook.

The following textbook is **strongly** recommended:

* Bryant and O'Halloran, [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, 3rd ed.](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/product/Bryant-Computer-Systems-A-Programmer-s-Perspective-3rd-Edition/9780134092669.html)

The following textbook is optional:

* Patterson and Hennessey, [Computer Organization and Design (MIPS edition)](https://www.elsevier.com/books/computer-organization-and-design-mips-edition/patterson/978-0-12-407726-3)

## Online resources

Lecture notes, assignments, and public information about the course will be posted
on the course website, <https://jhucsf.github.io/spring2020>.  You should check
the course website frequently.

We will be using Piazza for discussion and Q&amp;A.  The course's Piazza site
is <https://piazza.com/jhu/spring2020/601229>.

Assignments will be submitted using Gradescope: <https://www.gradescope.com/>.

## Course structure and expectations

Class meetings will consist of lecture and discussion, interspersed with
in-class activities.  We will be using *peer instruction* in the form of
clicker quizzes.  You will need to bring an iClicker 2 remote to each class
meetings.

## Grading

Your course grade will be determined as follows:

* Programming assignments: 55%
* Exams: 40%
* Clicker quizzes: 5%

## Late Days

You have a total of 5 *late days* to use as needed for homework assignments
throughout the course.  Each 24 hour period following an assignment deadline
is considered to be one late day: for example, if an assignment is due
at 10pm on Friday, but you submit your assignment at 11pm on Friday, you
have used one late day.  If you are planning on using more than two late
days on an assignment, please send a private message to the instructors on
Piazza to let us know.  Assignment submissions which exceed the maximum number
of late days will not be considered for credit.

## Academic integrity expectations

As with all CS courses, we expect that you will honor the CS Academic Integrity Code:
<https://www.cs.jhu.edu/academic-integrity-code/>

For this course, all assignments are *individual* assignments.  Copying or
sharing of code in any form is not allowed.  Any code or information resources
you use in your assignment must be properly acknowledged and cited.

## Students with Disabilities

Any student with a disability who may need accommodations in this class must obtain an
accommodation letter from Student Disability Services, Shaffer Hall Suite 101, (410)
