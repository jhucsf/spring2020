Welcome to the website for Computer Systems Fundamentals (Spring 2020) at <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>!

The course is about *computer systems* from the *programmer's perspective*.  We'll be making a fairly deep dive into topics such as data representation, memory, assembly language, CPU architecture, networks, and concurrency.  By the end of the course you'll know a lot about how modern computers really work and how to take advantage of their advanced features.

All public information about the course (readings, assignments, etc.) will be posted on this website.
