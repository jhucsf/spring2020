# Binary data representation

Assume that `uint8_t` is an unsigned, 8 bit integer data type.

Assume that `int8_t` is a signed, 8 bit, two's complement integer data type.

Consider the following C code:

```c
uint8_t a = 61,
        b = 129,
        c = 253;
int8_t  x = 42,
        y = -1,
        z = -126;
```

Write the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, `y`, and `z` in binary.
